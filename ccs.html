                    Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a technology that can capture up to 90% of the  carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions produced from the use of fossil fuels in electricity generation and industrial processes, preventing the carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere.

                  Around 40% of global CO2 emissions come from industry. CO2 capture and storage (CCS) can prevent up to 90% of industrial CO2 emissions from reaching the atmosphere. The CO2 emitted by industries such as electricity production, cement manufacture and oil and gas refining can be captured at source, transported, then stored safely and permanently, deep underground. Many of the technologies for CCS already exist and have been used in other industrial processes for many years. A number of large-scale CCS projects are already in operation across the world. The challenge now is to develop CCS for extended large-scale use in power generation and heavy industry.

                                  For decades, CO2 has been captured from emitting sources and sold for use by other industries, such as soft drink manufacturers. Existing capture technologies can be applied to large-scale industrial processes, such as power generation, oil and gas production and cement manufacture. Capturing CO2requires extra energy, but even taking this into account, the cost efficiency of CCS is still better than most forms of low-carbon energy generation. The main technical challenges now are to continue to address this 'energy penalty' and reduce operating costs. Three main technologies exist: post-combustion; pre-combustion and oxyfiring.

                            <h3>Post-combustion</h3>

                            <p>
                              With post-combustion, the fuel is combusted with air and the CO<sub>2</sub> is separated from the exhaust gases after the combustion, typically using liquid <span title="A substance, usually a liquid, capable of absorbing another substance">solvents</span>. The absorbed CO<sub>2</sub> is then removed from the solvent by heating. This technology is already used to capture CO<sub>2</sub> for use in the food and beverage industry and as a raw material in fertilizer manufacturing. Post-combustion capture can be retrofitted to existing plants or used in new-build industrial operations. However, the complexity of integrating it into existing plant systems has technical and cost implications, while the need for steam to recover the CO<sub>2</sub> can significantly reduce a power plant's generating capacity.

                            <h3>Pre-combustion</h3>
                            <video controls>

                            <p>Pre-combustion uses steam and air or oxygen to convert fuel into a mixture of mainly hydrogen and CO<sub>2</sub>. The CO<sub>2</sub> is separated using liquid <span class="qTip noSwipe" oldtitle="A substance, usually a liquid, capable of absorbing another substance" title="" data-hasqtip="true">solvents</span> or solid <span class="qTip noSwipe" oldtitle="A material that can extract certain substances from gases, liquids or solids by causing them to adhere to its surface" title="" data-hasqtip="true">adsorbents</span> while the hydrogen can then be burned without producing further CO<sub>2</sub> or used in refinery processes to create cleaner fuels. The pressure and concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> obtained through pre-combustion is relatively high, making separation easier to achieve. Pre-combustion has been used for many years in the industrial production of ammonia and hydrogen. However, the <span class="qTip noSwipe" oldtitle="Changing the properties of a fuel to make it more usable" title="" data-hasqtip="true">fuel conversion</span> steps required are relatively complex, making pre-combustion more suitable for use in new-build plants rather than retrofitting to existing plants.</p>

                            <p>Oxyfiring involves burning fuel in pure oxygen rather than air. This results in an exhaust gas made up largely of CO<sub>2</sub> and water vapour. Cooling and compressing this gas stream removes the water vapour and separates out the CO<sub>2</sub>. A final purification may be needed, depending on the level of impurities in the CO<sub>2</sub>.  One of the benefits of oxyfiring is that very high CO<sub>2</sub> capture rates (over 98%) are feasible. The <span class="qTip noSwipe" oldtitle="The energy needed to capture CO<sub>2</sub> in the CCS process" title="" data-hasqtip="true">energy penalty</span> in this case is related to the preparation of pure oxygen by air separation. Oxyfiring can be used in new builds and potentially retrofitted to existing plants.</p>

Ships may be viable for CO<sub>2</sub> transportation over long distances. Even if a suitable storage site lies directly beneath the source of capture, the captured CO<sub>2</sub> will have to be compressed and pumped underground.
                              Pipelining of gases and liquids is widespread throughout the world, and includes millions of tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> that are transported each year for use in <span class="qTip noSwipe" oldtitle="A technique to extract more oil by injecting CO<sub>2</sub> to flush it out, with some of the CO<sub>2</sub> remaining permanently stored" title="" data-hasqtip="true">Enhanced Oil Recovery</span> (EOR) operations and in emerging CCS projects.

                            <p>
                              After capture, CO<sub>2</sub> is compressed to the point that it becomes very dense like a liquid. The compressed CO<sub>2</sub> is then transported by pipeline to the storage site and is compressed further during injection. It increases in density until it reaches a depth of around 1500 meters (5000 feet), after which density becomes constant. In total, the volume of the CO<sub>2</sub> decreases by around 99% from capture, meaning considerable amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> can be stored in a given site.

                              The captured, compressed and transported CO<sub>2</sub> is injected via wells deep into the Earth's subsurface where it is stored in a near-liquid form in the pores of geological formations, ideally located at depths greater than 800 metres (2600 feet). These rock formations are carefully selected to have appropriate porosity (void space in the rocks) and <span class="qTip noSwipe" oldtitle="The connectivity between pores. Lava is very porous yet there is little connectivity so it is a poor storage candidate." title="" data-hasqtip="true">permeability</span> (allows fluid flow through the rocks), and are overlain by <span class="qTip noSwipe" oldtitle="One or more layers of impermeable, overlying rock which acts as a final seal to stored CO<sub>2</sub>" title="" data-hasqtip="true">impermeable caprock</span> layers which act as 'seals' to CO<sub>2</sub> and brine.

                              At these depths the CO<sub>2</sub> remains in a state that has a liquid-like density but a gas-like viscosity, properties which facilitate the injection and movement of CO<sub>2</sub> through the rock. In the storage formation, natural trapping processes help retain the CO<sub>2</sub> securely and permanently.

                  CCS is one of a suite of technologies that will all be required to combat climate change,  including renewables, nuclear and energy efficiency. The importance of CCS as one of the tools against global warming is highlighted in a report by the International Energy Agency, which found that CCS could contribute to a 19% reduction in global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050 and that fighting climate change could cost over 70% more without CCS.

                  The reason why we think CCS is pearl of ICT4D  is we believe that by using CCS we can cut the enviremontal impact of using coal for generating energy. As we mentioned before it is not easy to totally get rid of  fossil fuels but CCS provides us the way of minimizing the damage of fossil fuels consumptions.
